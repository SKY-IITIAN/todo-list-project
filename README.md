# 📝 To-Do List Web Page

This is my first front-end project as part of my learning journey in web development! I built a responsive **To-Do List** page using HTML and CSS, applying concepts from the **CSS Box Model**.

## 📦 What I Learned & Applied
🔹 CSS Box Model (content, padding, border, margin)  
🔹 Element sizing and layout control using `box-sizing`  
🔹 Responsive units like `vh` and `vw`  
🔹 Background styling using images, no-repeat, and cover  
🔹 Custom card and button design  
🔹 Color styling using HEX values and color picker tools

## 🎯 Features
- Clean and simple to-do list layout
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes
- Styled cards and buttons with padding, border-radius, and custom colors

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
